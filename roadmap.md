# Road Map
* create Jupyter Notebook

* Implementation
	* for 10 points question 
		* Plot #1 (no information so far) 
		* Plot #2 (no information so far) 
		* Plot #3 (no information so far)
	* for 20 points question
		* Clustering Visualisation (no justification so far)
	* for 20 points question
		* Interactive Plot #1 (no justification so far)
		* https://towardsdatascience.com/using-plotly-express-to-create-interactive-scatter-plots-3699d8279b9e
		* Interactive Plot #2 (no justification so far)
	* for 30 points question
		* Dashboard that encompasses 2 visualisations

* Justification/Information/Report
	* for 10 points question: explain in the information that the 3 visualisations provide. 
	* for 20 points question: justify your selection and identify interesting features in the graph (Clustering Visualisation)
	* for 20 points question: justify the functionality, design, colour selection and any other details that you deem important.
	* for 30 points question: minimal description about dashboard
	* prettify Jupyter Notebook

# Time MGMT
* implementation
	* Monday 4 hours (4e)
	* Tuesday 4 hours (2m 2e)
	* Wednesday 6 hours (2m 4e)
	* Thursday 4 hours (4e)
	* Friday 2 hours (2m)
	* Saturday Morning 4
* justification
	* Saturday Afternoon 8 hours
	* Sunday 8 hours

100 points for 40 hours = 2.5 points/hour

## DONE:
* Convert TeX into MS Word/DOC/DOCX: https://cloudconvert.com/ and fix later. Convert once a day
