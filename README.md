# CA2 50% Individual

Online retailer, eBay is providing an option of bidding to their customers globally. Bidding is employed to find the real price of items in the market based on the demand. The price offered by anyone participating in this process is termed as a 'bid'. A dataset is available at the following link and on Moodle for the bidding of customers https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset

Normal bids are classified as ‘0’ bids in the data set and anomalous bids as ‘1’. Your goal is to use classification or clustering algorithms to predict the bids in the future. You would need to develop the machine learning models and supporting visualizations in order to understand the details of information obtained from the modelling part.

## Data Visualization Techniques

* Use at least 3 plots to gain valuable insight about some of the variables. Explain in the information that the visualisations provide. [0-10]
* Perform a clustering  visualisation using a library of your choice. Justify your selection and identify interesting features in the graph.[0-20]
* Create at least two interactive plots based on the data. Justify the functionality, design, colour selection and any other details that you deem important.[0-20]
* Create a Dashboard using a library of your choice that encompasses at least 2 of your visualizations [0-30]


## Report 

**Submissions that are suspected of plagiarism and/or inclusion of AI (ChatGPT, Bard, etc…) Generated content will be referred to the college authorities.** 
* A report is required to provide the details of work performed in all tasks. 
* The report should be based on Introduction, rationale of data visualization techniques, and conclusions. 
* Illustrations should be used to highlight the details of any section. 
* This should also include evidence to support your data visualization techniques through the use of references and citations. 
* Conclusions, Findings of data set and references/citations in (HARVARD style). 
* Number of words should not exceed 1250+/-%10 excluding references, title, code, citations, headings and Table of Contents.

## Learning Outcomes:
Please note this is not the assessment task. The task to be completed is detailed on the next page. This CA will assess student attainment of the following minimum intended learning outcomes:

### Data Visualization Techniques
* MLO 1 - Explain the concepts, techniques and processes underlying data visualisation (Linked to PLO 1).
* MLO 2 - Select appropriate data visualisation techniques for a given use case and data characteristics (Linked to PLO 3 (Stage 4 SLO 3).
* MLO 3 - Propose, design, develop, and implement data visualisation solutions. (Linked to PLO 4).
* MLO 4 - Display effective presentation skills to communicate with peers, team members and project stakeholders (Linked to PLO 3, PLO 6)

## Submission Requirements
All assessment submissions must meet the minimum requirements listed below. Failure to do so may have implications for the mark awarded. All assessment submissions must:
* Be submitted before 28th May 2023 as a Jupyter Notebook file.
* The Jupyter Notebook File Must be saved as “YourName_DP_ML_HDip_CA2.ipynb”
* Be submitted by the deadline date specified or be subject to late submission penalties
* Be submitted via Moodle upload
* Use Harvard Referencing when citing third party material 
* Be the student’s own work.
